A most basic go program redirecting to hard coded URL.

Tooling is auto-installed via [hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/).

For local development run `make run` and `make help` for more options.

Shenanigans to make it run on local k3s cluster:

- Dockerfile
- K8s manifests
- GitHub Action CI/CD pushing to Dockerhub
